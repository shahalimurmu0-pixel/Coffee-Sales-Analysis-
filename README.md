# Coffee-Sales-Insights (Interactive Dashboard using Exce)

##  Summary
An interactive dashboard built with Excel to analyze coffee sales, revenue, and customer payment trends.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales transactions to uncover customer preferences, product performance, and payment behavior. The dashboard provides a clear view of which coffee types are most popular, how much revenue they generate, and the distribution of payment methods across different days

## Problem Statement
Coffee sales data is recorded across multiple transactions, but raw tables make it difficult to identify meaningful patterns. Without proper cleaning and visualization, businesses cannot easily see which coffee types drive revenue, how payment methods differ, or which days generate the highest sales.

## Tools and Techniques
- MS Excel → used for cleaning the dataset (removed duplicates, formatted columns, handled missing values)
- Pivot Tables & Charts → summarized sales data and created visuals for coffee types, revenue, payment methods, and top days
- Slicers → added for interactive filtering by coffee type, payment type, and date
- Dashboard Design → combined charts, slicers, and KPIs into a single interactive Excel dashboard


## Questions (KPIs)
- Which coffee type is sold most frequently
- Which coffee type generates the highest revenue
- What is the total revenue and average revenue per transaction
- Which days record the highest revenue
- What is the distribution of payment methods (Card vs Cash)
- Which customers (card numbers) contribute the most revenue
- Revenue trend across different dates
- Which coffee types dominate top revenue days
